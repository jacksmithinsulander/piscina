# PISCINA 

Piscina is an API to fetch the latest added LP pairs on several EVM compatible blockchains. This project also happens to be my exam project for my studies in blockchain development at [Medieinstitutet](https://medieinstitutet.se/)


## Change of plans

So I _slightly_ deviated from the original plan regarding my techstack. The crimes commited are as follows:

#### ~~Typescript~~ --> [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
#### ~~Docker~~ --> [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
#### ~~Redis~~ --> [Persy](https://persy.rs/)
#### ~~Express~~ --> [Actix](https://actix.rs/docs/server/)

I think this change, however, achieved the API to be __blazingly__ fast. Also a plus to have a super hipp tech stack ðŸ˜Ž
